Let’s see an example for a request

Step 1

The user input http:// xyz.com in the browser and hits ‘enter’.

Step 2

Once the user hit this URL, the browser will send the page request over the Internet to the web server.

Step 3

Web server will receive the request and analyze the request information. In web server’s configuration file, site’s root path is specified. Based on that, web server will look for index.php file in that root directory, since URL doesn’t contain any sub directory or any other routes.

Step 4

Web server will direct the request to public/index.php file of laravel application.

Step 5

In this step, PHP Interpreter is executing the code contained in the index.php file from the request. During this step, auto loader files which are generated by composer will be loaded.

Step 6

Then it will create the laravel instance and bootstrapping the components of laravel.

Step 7

The kernel will receive the request, load the service providers and will be redirected to router.

Step 8

Router will render the view file content and return back to web server.

Step 9

Web server receives the output from PHP and sends it back over the Internet to a user’s web browser.

Step 10

The user’s web browser receives the response from the server, and renders the web page on user’s computer.
